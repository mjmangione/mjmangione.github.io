        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
          I am 25 years old, currently living in Brooklyn. Recently I have been traveling in South America (Chile, Brazil and Argentina), improving my Spanish, writing, and exploring this part of the world. More than anything, I love to learn. Beyond my interest in math and technology, I am passionate about aquaculture, economics, literature, film, and contemporary art. In my free time, I enjoy writing, connecting with nature, and gardening.

        <h5>Experience</h5>
        <p>
          I spent the last two years working as a Performance Engineer at Moviri. This was a customer facing role, which aided clients in implementing technologies and processes for the optimization of IT systems. This was accomplished through designing data architectures and ETLs to monitor performance. Across several large companies, we brought performance observability across their (often enormous) digital infrastructures, resulting in a vast reduction of cloud and overhead spending.

        <h5>Education</h5>
        <p>
          I am a graduate of the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Sciences in <a href="https://acms.washington.edu/">Applied and Computational Mathematical Sciences</a>. This degree encompasses my interests in applied and theoretical computer science, data analysis, and pure and applied mathematics. I also minored in Art History, which has furthered my interest in the humanities and their relation to technology.

        <h5>Mission</h5>
        <p>
          As a technologist with an invested interest in the world, it is impossible to deny the transformative power of technology in our society. It is a powerful tool capable of creating and destroying traditions, ways of thinking, and the very frameworks for which humans interact with each other.
          <br><br>
          I am passionate about technology in the sense that I believe in its capability for positive creation, its necessity for building a better future. With this comes the utmost responsibility in deciding how and when to deploy this power.
          <br><br>
          I bring an interdisciplinary approach to development which spans across my interests in technology, economics, philosophy and design. Utilizing this background, I have a perspective which allows to solve problems creatively and purposefully. It is my goal to develop systems which can have a concrete impact in the material world, which benefit the human interest in our interaction with the technological.
